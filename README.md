# 📊 Sales Performance Dashboard

## 📁 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance to assess marketing campaign effectiveness, understand sales trends, evaluate customer feedback, and analyze product return rates. We use **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to build a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

---

## 📊 Dataset Details
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Structure:** Includes fields like **Product ID**, **Product Name**, **Quantity Sold**, **Price**, **Profit**, **Discount (%)**, **Order Date**, **Ship Date**, **Category**, **Status**, **Feedback Rating**, etc.
- **Objective:** To derive insights for data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Data preprocessing and cleaning (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- **SQLite:** Database management and SQL querying
- **Power BI:** Data visualization and dashboard creation

---

## 🔧 Project Steps
### 1. Data Preparation (Python)
- Handled missing values and standardized text data.
- Converted date columns to the format `dd/mm/yyyy`.
- Removed duplicate records for accuracy.

### 2. Data Analysis (SQL)
- Analyzed sales trends, top products, and customer feedback.
- Used SQL functions like `SUM()`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `strftime()`.

### 3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Created visualizations to illustrate:
  - **Monthly Sales Trends** (Line Chart)
  - **Top Products and Profit Analysis** (Bar Chart)
  - **Customer Feedback Distribution** (Pie/Donut Chart) with grouped ratings from **0 to 5**
- Implemented slicers for dynamic filtering by **Category**, **State**, and **Order Date**.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified peak sales periods and high-performing products.
- Analyzed customer feedback to understand satisfaction levels.
- Evaluated return patterns to minimize future losses.
